## Performance Testing for Web App:

## Page Load Time:

* [ ] Verify that all pages load within an acceptable time frame (e.g., under 3 seconds).
* [ ] Optimize server response time to minimize delays.
* [ ] Minimize the number of HTTP requests by optimizing assets (images, scripts, stylesheets).
* [ ] Evaluate and improve the order of loading critical resources (e.g., prioritize above-the-fold content).
* [ ] Implement lazy loading for images and content below the fold.

## Resource Optimization:

* [ ] Compress and optimize images and files to reduce their size.
* [ ] Implement browser caching with appropriate cache control headers.
* [ ] Minify JavaScript and CSS files to reduce download size.
* [ ] Use asynchronous loading for non-essential scripts.
* [ ] Employ a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for assets to distribute load geographically.

## Scalability and Load Handling:

* [ ] Conduct load testing to determine the website's capacity under different levels of traffic.
* [ ] Implement auto-scaling mechanisms to handle traffic spikes.
* [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes for improved query performance.
* [ ] Load test with simulated real-world user scenarios to assess performance.
* [ ] Monitor server response times and performance metrics during load tests.

## Error Handling:

* [ ] Test how the website handles errors and failures under load.
* [ ] Implement graceful degradation for features that may fail under heavy load.
* [ ] Use proper HTTP status codes and error messages in responses.
* [ ] Monitor and log errors during load tests for analysis.
* [ ] Define a strategy for notifying administrators about critical errors.

## Performance Monitoring:

* [ ] Set up performance monitoring tools to track key metrics over time.
* [ ] Monitor server health, response times, and resource utilization.
* [ ] Establish baseline performance metrics for comparison during load tests.
* [ ] Implement automated alerts for abnormal performance patterns.
* [ ] Continuously analyze monitoring data to identify opportunities for optimization.
